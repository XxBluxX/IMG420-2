Currently uploaded are the src files created to make the custom nodes. The intention was to make nodes that would simplify the detection process. The EnemySpider node would have had the spiders strafing across the screen and when touched emitted a player touched signal to announce that the game should end. The GoalKey was intended have a similar function that would send a signal when the key was collected and allow for easy removal and replacement of the key. I was unable to fully implement these nodes as I came across issues with my gdext install. In the future I intend to begin projects much sooner so that there is time to get help when problems such as this arise. 

I apologize, even given an extension I was unable to properly develop this project. I only had a short amount of time this morning that I could work on it before I had capstone commitments, otherwise I would have continued to do my best and get this project sorted out.
